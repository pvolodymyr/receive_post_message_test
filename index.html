							<h3>Factory warranty</h3>
							<p>
								A factory warranty is provided by the vehicle manufacturer on
								purchase of a new car and covers certain repairs or replacements
								for about 2-4 years or a certain mileage. Typically, factory
								warranties only cover defects in materials or workmanship, and
								do not cover wear and tear or routine maintenance. Once the
								factory warranty expires, you are out of protection.

							<h3>Vehicle Service Contracts</h3>
							<p>
								<strong
									>Vehicle Service Contracts (VSC), also known as "Extended
									warranties", "Extended car warranties", or "Mechanical
									breakdown protection", provide coverage for certain repairs
									after the original factory warranty has expired. </strong
								><br />If you need your car to go to work or manage your life,
								they are often the best way to protect yourself from sudden high
								costs a faulty part can create. <br />There are vast differences
								in coverage, monthly price and services included. Some plans
								offer additional benefits such as roadside assistance or rental
								car coverage. Thus, we recommend comparing and reading the
								contract before purchasing a plan to avoid any disappointment.
								Naturally, we believe that Chaiz is the best way to do this.

								Car insurance covers the cost of damage or injuries resulting

								requirement in 49 out of 50 states.<br /><strong

					<h4>Is it right for you?</h4>
					<p>
						To decide whether you need a VSC/extended car warranty, depends on
						your personal need for your car. A mechanical breakdown is 50x more
						likely than an accident and once the factory warranty is over, any
						mechanical issue has to be paid out of your own pockets. So ask
						yourself: "Can I pay for a $1000 repair without issues?". Repairs
						can easily get more expensive than that and we see a VSC also as a
						great budgeting and financial planning tool.<br />

		<h1>Compare and buy breakdown protection from top providers</h1>
		<p>
			Chaiz is an online marketplace designed to help consumers compare and buy
			extended vehicle warranties. It aggregates offerings from multiple
			third-party auto warranty providers, allowing users to research, compare,
			and purchase vehicle protection plans entirely online.
		</p>
		<h3>Chaiz offers three main types of coverage plans:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Powertrain Coverage:</b>
				<p>
					Covers essential components like the engine, transmission, and drive
					axles.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Powertrain Plus Coverage:</b>
				<p>
					Includes everything in the Powertrain plan plus additional components
					such as brakes, steering, and air conditioning.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Most Comprehensive (Bumper-to-Bumper) Coverage:</b>
				<p>
					Covers almost all vehicle components, listing only the exclusions.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Users can enter their car's details (make, model, year, license plate, and
			odometer reading) to view available plans, compare them based on coverage
			and price, and select the most suitable one. Chaiz emphasizes transparent
			pricing with no hidden fees and offers the convenience of purchasing plans
			directly online, which can result in significant cost savings compared to
			traditional dealership options​ (CarWarrantyHub)​​ (Chaiz)​​
			(ConsumersAdvocate)​.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, it is important to note that Chaiz itself is not a direct
			provider of these warranties. Instead, it acts as a middleman, connecting
			users with various warranty companies. This means that while Chaiz
			facilitates the comparison and purchase process, any claims or issues with
			the warranties would need to be handled by the actual warranty provider​
			(Several.com)​.
		</p>

		<p>
			Additionally, Chaiz's services are not available in California, and
			customers in this state will need to look elsewhere for their extended
			warranty needs​ (Several.com)​.
