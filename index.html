		<h1>Compare and buy breakdown protection from top providers</h1>
		<p>
			Chaiz is an online marketplace designed to help consumers compare and buy
			extended vehicle warranties. It aggregates offerings from multiple
			third-party auto warranty providers, allowing users to research, compare,
			and purchase vehicle protection plans entirely online.
		</p>
		<h3>Chaiz offers three main types of coverage plans:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Powertrain Coverage:</b>
				<p>
					Covers essential components like the engine, transmission, and drive
					axles.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Powertrain Plus Coverage:</b>
				<p>
					Includes everything in the Powertrain plan plus additional components
					such as brakes, steering, and air conditioning.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Most Comprehensive (Bumper-to-Bumper) Coverage:</b>
				<p>
					Covers almost all vehicle components, listing only the exclusions.
				</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Users can enter their car's details (make, model, year, license plate, and
			odometer reading) to view available plans, compare them based on coverage
			and price, and select the most suitable one. Chaiz emphasizes transparent
			pricing with no hidden fees and offers the convenience of purchasing plans
			directly online, which can result in significant cost savings compared to
			traditional dealership options​ (CarWarrantyHub)​​ (Chaiz)​​
			(ConsumersAdvocate)​.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, it is important to note that Chaiz itself is not a direct
			provider of these warranties. Instead, it acts as a middleman, connecting
			users with various warranty companies. This means that while Chaiz
			facilitates the comparison and purchase process, any claims or issues with
			the warranties would need to be handled by the actual warranty provider​
			(Several.com)​.
		</p>

		<p>
			Additionally, Chaiz's services are not available in California, and
			customers in this state will need to look elsewhere for their extended
			warranty needs​ (Several.com)​.
